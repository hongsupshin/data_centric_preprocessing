# Abstract

Data problems are the main challenges when building real-world ML applications. Nevertheless, efforts to address the data issues are often under-valued due to the hype surrounding ML models. This study highlights the importance of a data pipeline that handles unique data problems in hardware verification. Here, data shape and types change over time where the data already have high heterogeneity, dimensionality, and feature obscurity without a schema. This can cause data leakage, pipeline jungle, and low model performance. I propose a data-centric ML pipeline that is adaptive to data changes during model serving by preprocessing training data using an inferred schema from the data themselves. It also monitors any feature changes and resolves training-serving mismatches, which increases robustness and efficiency. This pipeline also allows “data tuning” (tuning preprocessing methods), which improved model performance significantly from a real-world benchmark testing.
